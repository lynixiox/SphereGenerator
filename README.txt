This is a terraformer game that was made in 48 hours for one of the 
Ludum Dare Game James.

The part that I am showing if was the ability to figure out a way to 
create spheres with hexagons at any number of iterations that i liked
by changing the "size" variable within the spherecreation scipt you can
change how big the planet being generated will be. 

This is running of unity version 2019.3.0f6 

if you want to play the game you can go into the exe folder and run the
terraformer V2 executable. Its v2 because it was my second attempt at a 
game like this. In the first attempt i asked my 3D artists to model flat
planes for me and i created a sphere with those. that was not ideal. with 
the knowledge obtained from drawing verticies in Vulkan and openGL i tried
to implement it here to create the hexagons. 

to play click on a tile on the world. 
click on the tree and then add some wheat. And then add a cow to eat the
wheat. Add a tree to create oxygen for the cow and the cow provides Co2
for the cow. each tile can have 3 resources. The resources will spread
to other tiles based on how well the ecosystem is going. if the wheat
grows out of hand add some locusts and then some birds to control the locusts
and fox's to control the bird population until eventuall you might get
an ecosystem where things are growing and dying just like the circle of life
